Notes on creating a task.

I have so far created GSIOC-related tasks.
In this case, the only time it has worked is if Instrument Name is specified (as "Liquid Handler" or as "Pump") along with the ID (10 or 30, respectively).

Do not modify methods while one is running! I did this and apparently caused a crash!


C:\Users\uvcom\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313-32
I downloaded a python executable from python.org and ran the following.
"/c/Users/uvcom/Downloads/python-3.13.5.exe" -m venv py313-32
I made sure to check "Add to path". This placed the python executable file at
C:\Users\uvcom\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313-32

I then created a directory at
Users/uvcom/dev/py313-32 and navigated there.
I then ran  "C:/Users/uvcom/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python313-32/python.exe" -m venv py313-32-env

to create an environment.

I activated it by navigating there and running
source path/to/env/Scripts/activate

and deactivated it by doing
deactivate
